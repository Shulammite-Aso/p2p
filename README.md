## Portfolia
This is currently an incomplete project. But the idea is to make an app where users create an account and get access to a simple portfolio page/templete where can edit the template to make it thier own. And then be able to share link to their profile to friends and potential customers/employers.

## Update
Currently building a 3-tier version which may replace this.

## Current features & tools
- User authentication with firebase
- DB storage with firebase/firestore
- Styling with react-bootstrap
- Routing with react-router-dom
